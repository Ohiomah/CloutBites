Differentiating between review ratings and engagement metrics

Accounting for influencer reach (e.g., follower count, engagement rates)

Data Sources and Collection Plan

We will collect restaurant and user data from structured review platforms and social media APIs:

Primary Datasets:

1. Review Data:

- Yelp Fusion API (structured reviews, star ratings, restaurant metadata) - this is only used so far 

2. Social Media Data:

- Twitter (via Tweepy): Tweets mentioning restaurants, engagement metrics (only New York, after 2023)

- Instagram (via Instaloader): Influencer posts/tags (only New York, after 2023)

- Reddit (via API): Mentions in food-related subreddits (only New York, after 2023)

Restricted Focus: 

Restaurants in New York (since Beli was founded there)

Social media influencers with 10K+ followers (to capture trends effectively)

User-generated content from 2023 onward to ensure relevance


THIS IS BIPARTITE (recommend acknowledgement)

1. Can we identify user communities based on shared preferences?

2. How does social proof (people talk online!) contribute to restaurant popularity?
