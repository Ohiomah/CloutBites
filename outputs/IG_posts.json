The other service just has more meats offered to those parties.\n\nThis is the first ever establishment to offer halal Brazilian barbecue in NYC. They got rid of all their pork too. The separate halal only service has been overseen by a practicing Muslim who has brought this idea forward to them and has been trained by him for months to prevent all measurements of any cross-contamination. You don’t have to worry about non-halal stocks or gravies in the side dishes or wine being basted onto the meats like how they do at other Brazilian steakhouses.\n\nThey offer an all-you-can-eat buffet for the same price of $35/person despite halal meat being much more expensive than the meats they previously had. The buffet station is fully halal.\n\nThey do have a bar, but the mocktails menu specifically uses different supplies and is in a separate area in the bar. The owner made sure to purchase new mixing products for this.\n\nPlease make a reservation, they operate in that matter anyways, and you’ll be better off that way in actually getting a table here.

They are also right next to each other, so I recommend spending half day exploring these two areas! \n\nFollow @jerica.feasts for more of my 12 day Japan trip! ✨\n\n. \n. \n. \n\n#japantravel #japanvlogs #minivlogs #japanfoodie #japanfood #tokyofood #tokyoitinerary #tokyocurry #tokyocafes #tokyocoffee #tokyoshopping #japanthrifting #Imdonut #japandonuts #japanpizza #tokyopizza #nakameguro #daikanyama",

Some of her family fled the Nakba, while others left the West Bank, seeking a new life in the U.S. 🇺🇸 But her fight didn’t stop there. As a single mother of four, she revived her mother’s catering business after losing her job for speaking up for her motherland via her personal social media.\n\nIsraa’s knafeh, a taste of Nablus, is steadily winning over the East Coast Muslim community.

The nigiri were pretty mid—not super fresh.\n\nThe scallop roll, plus the uni and toro roll, were much better. These definitely were my favorite of the meal, and I enjoyed them, but I wouldn’t go out of my way for them.\n\nOverall, I still finished everything, but I probably wouldn’t put it at the top of your list to try. 🍣\n\n#nycsushi #sushi #sushireview #nycsushitakeout #uni #toro #nycrestaurants #maruminyc #greenwichvillage #sushinyc",

The experience is quicker than a typical omakase and may depend on how much you order. So my recommendation is to keep ordering since you should try all their delicious fish anyway 😅\n\nThe chefs here come from Michelin restaurants & this truly comes thru in the food. I enjoy how they use light garnishes and do not overpower the fish so the quality shines. Plus this is how it is in Japan anyway… authentic style. 🇯🇵 \n\nLove this spot. If you’re new to omakase, definitely the perfect place to start.

I enjoyed this one because it had a nice balance of sweet from the fig jam and saltiness from the bacon. Fire slice. The second slice was a classic pepperoni because why not.

(I got the spicy tuna roll with no crunch cus I like to taste the fish more) this was definitely a solid set. The quality of the fish wasn’t anything super impressive but for this price and to hit your sushi craving on a budget it definitely does the trick. \n\n🥭 The mango madness roll was interesting. I didn’t love the spicy salmon inside cus it didn’t have much taste (maybe cus I didn’t remove the tempura). The mango, avocado and kani was tasty, but when you ate it all together it tasted a bit muddled and I kinda wanted to take it apart. If you like these crazy types of rolls give it a shot, but it may have had too many elements competing in my mouth so it didn’t hit as hard for me. \n\nOverall it was a good spot for affordable sushi and I would rate it a 7.2/10 ⭐️\n\n#sushi #sushinyc #nycsushi #nycsushitakeout #nycrestaurants #murrayhill #murrayhillnyc #nycsushibar #sushilover",

The room is dark red, has a gorgeous piano and this bar surely attracts a cool crowd🎹 Now that we know the vibe and people watching are A+ let’s get into the food (and more importantly the potato).\n\nFirst we started with ‘The Nines’ cocktail which was passionfruit flavor and it was the perfect balance of sweet and sour. Every table also gets some snacks of popcorn 🍿 olives 🫒 and potato chips.\n\nFor a starter we got the hamachi and it was the perfect light appetizer and had nice thick pieces of fish. Then we got the famous burger which was perfect to split since it was definitely decadent 🍔 I also loved the thin and crispy fries on the side. \n\nNow the POTATO. This is a twice backed potato where they scoop out the insides and mix it with a bunch of cheese and butter. Then they plop 30g of osetra caviar. The short answer is Yes… this is a very delicious treat. It is fun to get for an occasion, but do you absolutely need it? Probably not. However I am very happy we did splurge since I am a caviar lover 🤤 Also 30 grams of osetra on its own can be $99 so you might as well get it on a yummy potato in one of the coolest bars in the city. \n\n#thenines #nycbar #nyccocktails #nycpianobar #nyccocktailbar #nycdatespot #nycdatenight #nycrecs #nyceats #caviarpotato #osetracaviar #nyccaviar #caviarlover #pianobar #nycblogger #nycinfluencer #nyctourist",

Honestly, one of my favorite special rolls ever…\n\nThe Blue Fin King ($24.00) was also tasty, but I do have to say the Toro was not as buttery and quality as I usually have. It was good but not worth the $24 in my opinion so prob won’t order again.\n\nSpicy Crunch Yellowtail ($11.50) - this was a super solid hand roll great amount of fish and I asked for light crunch so there wasn’t too much tempura.\n\noverall, absolutely loved this spot .They have so many fun fancy rolls to try and they do the basics right. \n\n#NycSushi #NycSushiTakeout #sushitakeout #nycomakase #nyctakeout #nycrestaurants #nycfood #nycfoodie #nyceats #sushilovers",

Mama’s Too in the West Village has become a top 3 slice shop for me, and for good reason. I will say, I got all corner pieces and absolutely love the crunch these slices give. The Angry Nonna hands down my favorite. Hot soppressata, plum tomato sauce and housemate hot honey. Straight FIRE. The poached pear with gorgonzola dolce and hot honey is a close second because anytime you combine sweet and savory, it’s a win in my book. And finally the Cacio e Pepe was such a unique slice. 4 cheese blend with cracked black pepper. Highly recommend Mama’s Too if you’re looking for fire slices in NYC",

The ambiance makes you feel like you’re on a vacation.\n\nOur expectations were very high to say the least, and it had exceeded our expectations once we walked through the door. It felt like a museum experience (sans blatant colonialism), something that is definitely not in your mind when you’re going out for dinner lol.\n\nIt took Chef Vikas Khanna and a whole village to produce Bungalow and we’ve been following closely for months 😆.

It’s run by a group of Turkish brothers who’ve grown up in the Bronx and wanted to help give back to the Muslim community through Turkish culture. Thus Duha was born, and not a far-fetched concept to marry the concept of cafes and gas stations, like in Türkiye! This truck is whipping up pizza pies, pastas, burgers, and incredible coffee!\n\nHere’s our review!\n\nFood: 8.5/10\nThe food here is really good and gives you that ✨food truck vibe✨. We started off with the beef pepperoni personal pie and buffalo chicken personal pie. Doughs are kneaded and baked on the spot. Both pies had tons of flavor and were crispy, but we particularly loved the spicy bite that the buffalo chicken pizza had.  We then had the cheese steak hero which was more reminiscent of a sliced beef sandwich but was delicious nonetheless, followed by the chicken cutlet sandwich on a roll which was an overall tasty sandwich. For pastas we ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and this was probably our favorite bite. The dish was brimming with melted cheese and hearty tomato sauce. It was comforting and delicious. For breakfast items we tried to Turkish omelette, which consisted of Turkish pepperoni, and a side of hash browns. The omelette needed a touch more salt but the Turkish pepperoni was yummy and made for a good quick on-the-go meal. We couldn’t leave without trying their coffee and baklava which they are well-known for. The owner was incredibly kind to whip up some special drinks for us like the “mochaccino.” And normally, Turkish coffee is a bit strong for our liking but this coffee did not taste bitter at all! We 100% recommend trying the strawberry iced latte too. Yes, real strawberry chunks on the bottom. Was hesitant to try, but it checks out. For dessert, def consider trying their strawberry Turkish magnolia pudding - you need a certain self-restraint to not devour the milky, creamy, not to sweet pudding in one sitting.\n\n(review continued in comments)\n\nDuha Cafe & Pizza (@duhacafepizza)\n📍1610 Eastchester Rd, Bronx, NY 10461",

The menu indicates which items are halal with an (H). We had the French toast (halal turkey) bacon, egg, and cheese, brisket tacos, eggs benedict with halal turkey bacon, mac and cheese skillet with buffalo chicken, truffles fries, and mocktails such as iced cherry blossom, mango sunset, and a lavender mojito. The presentation and taste of all these dishes were wonderful and we thoroughly enjoyed each dish. What stood out to us the most were the French toast BEC and bricket tacos. The BEC was a comforting ‘sink-your-teeth-into’ sandwich with a creative, sweet twist that works. The tacos have braised beef brisket, pickled onions, cotija, avocado, chipotle bbq which will leave you with a lingering spicy aftertaste. We also loved the drinks that we got. There were a ton of drinks that we wanted to try and it was difficult to narrow it down to three. They’re served in a huge glass so portion size was on point, so you don’t have to ration your drink during your entire stay. 😂\n\n(review continued in comments)\n\nBite Food & Coffee Co.

We had the Cheebu Jen (or Thieboudienne), which is jollof rice with fish, and the Mafe which had beef in it that was cooked in a creamy rich peanut sauce served with rice. We felt like we were missing out on the chicken and lamb but these two dishes made us really satisfied. We loved how fragrant the Cheebu Jen was. It is the national dish of Senegal. The rice was delicate and nicely cooked and the fish also had good flavor too. It was a little on the drier side, but there were nice additions that accompanied the dish that were provided that enhanced the texture, like stewed carrots, cassava, sautéed cabbage, eggplant and lime. The Mafe was beautiful. Despite being presented in a shroud of oil on the surface (we scooped it off), we enjoyed the stew accompanied with rice. The flavor was a rich, pungent, tangy, spicy peanut and tomato sauce flavor.

It’s a small Korean restaurant with great reviews and yes, some chicken sandos. I went for the house spicy chicken and corn tea. after tax and tip, total came out to $20.77. \n\nThis sandwich was beautiful! This was a super tasty sandwich, but unfortunately there are a few things that hinder me from rating this 9 and above. First thing is a personal preference, but I like a cohesive sandwich. They use tenders for the chicken and while it’s not a bad thing, it leads me to the 2nd reason, this made for an extremely messy experience. It may just be me being sloppy but it was all over the place. And lastly, I ordered a “spicy” chicken sandwich. It was not spicy at all, but super sweet. I think the contrast of flavors work, but being advertised as “spicy” is a bit misleading. BUT, again, maybe my tolerance went up and its just me. \n\nOverall, I had an amazing experience at Kuku Chicken and I’m giving this a solid 8/10. If you’re in the area, I recommend stopping by and trying this out. See you in the next episode!",

It’s a traditional Dominican sandwich made with pan de agua, grilled Argentinian sausage, green tomatoes, onions, cabbage, ketchup mayo, hot sauce and mustard. I swear I’m slowly becoming Dominican.\n\nThey also have other fillings like ground beef and sliced eggs called the Frikitaki. Then there’s the tres golpes chimi. Fried salami, fried cheese and fried egg. If this doesn’t make you say KE LO KE idk what will. \n\nThank you Max for making these tasty sandwiches",

The chicken is hand-slaughtered.\n\nHERE IS OUR REVIEW:\n\nFood: 9.5/10\nPeriod. The food was nothing short of a good meal that you want to have for lunch or dinner. You’re craving something light? You want something fried? Something in between? They have it. They still have yet to tell us their recipe for their macaroni and cheese because we don’t come by to Ditmars Blvd often 🫣. It had a perfect combination of baked cheese, gooey cheese, and that nutty and buttery profile flavor. Their rotisserie chicken is seasoned and cooked to perfection and so juicy. Their salads are fresh and they have tons of options so go crazy. Their market sides are nice addition to add to your protein like mashed potatoes, sweet yams, steamed veggies, or Egyptian rice. Their chicken and waffles sandwich game is on point as well as the pasta. I actually recreated the pasta at home the next week because I enjoyed the sauce a lot 😭 the juices and smoothies are super refreshing.\n\nPrice: 8.5/10\nYou know those gourmet restaurants you walk by on 6th Ave in Manhattan? The ones that you never go in because 1) it’s not halal 2) the prices are not it? The prices here make sense. Too generous almost.\n\nAtmosphere: 8/10\nIt’s a casual and quirky atmosphere with vibrant orange walls and a good number of seating to enjoy your meal.\n\nService: 10/10\nIt’s family-owned. The workers are neighborhood people. They live and breathe the neighborhood. They are always open to feedback and what could be improved. You order at counter and pick up the food. Food is made pretty fast.\n\nFlaming Grill (@flaminggrillnyc)\n📍3507 Ditmars Blvd, Queens, NY 11105\n\n(invite / collab)\n\n#halal #halalfoodnyc #halaleats #astoria #queens #rotisseriechicken #rotisserie #gourmet #halalgourmet #nyc #nychalalrestaurants #foodie #nycfoodie #newforkcity #egyptian #egyptianowned #halalrestaurant #halalrestaurants #ditmarsblvd #nyceeeeeats #eatingnyc #eatingnewyork #halalblog #foodblog #halalfoodblogger #muslimfoodies",

It’s served with mint yogurt chutney and maple syrup (kind of threw us off), and fries or diesel fries which are thick cut masala fries.\n\nPrices are $6.50 for the meat rolls and $8 for the vegetarian roll which isn’t that bad.\n\nThe flavors of the rolls were standard but the portion seemed a little underwhelming.

They serve up Singaporean-Malaysian Cuisine that’s perfect for the winter, AND they’re also at Bryant Park Winter Village so you can absolutely cozy up with a hot meal from Padi! Here’s our review from our visit a while back.\n\nFood: 9/10\nWe got the chicken and lamb sate, lontong (rice cake dish in stewed coconut gravy and vegetables), mee rebus (noodles with spicy potato gravy), mee bakso (meatball noodle soup), and beef rendang. We thought everything was well-made and perfectly spiced. The sate was charred nicely and the addition of their homemade tangy and salty peanut sauce was great to help contrast the flavors. At Bryant Park Winter Village, we definitely recommend trying the curries and soups if they’re available, like the mee rebus and mee bakso. It will clear up your sinuses and make you probably question if you should visit another stall after this. The beef rendang was tender and a pleasure to eat with plain white rice.\n\nPrice: 6.5/10\nPrices are more on the expensive side, an average dish can cost you $16-20.\n\nAtmosphere: -/-\nIt’s located inside the shared space of Urban Hawker and there’s lots of seating and tables.\n\nService: 10/10\nFood is made pretty fast and staff is super helpful in helping you understand the menu items and flavor palette you’re looking for.\n\nPadi d’NYC (@padidnyc)\n📍135 W 50th St, New York, NY 10020\n\n#halal #halalfood #nycbucketlist #halalblogger #halalfoodnyc #singaporeanfood #malaysianfood #urbanhawker #manhattan #midtown #halalfoodinnyc #halaleats #foodblogger #foodreview #meebakso #satay #southeastasian #cuisine #foodie #nyceeeeeeats #nychalalfood #nyc #nyceats #newforkcity #delicious #bryantparkwintervillage",

Needless to say, fighting off tourists burned a lot of energy (and patience) and therefore worked up my appetite. 🌚\n\nI can imagine folks who are walking all day, showing out-of-towners sights and tours may feel the same way. I found myself standing on 50th and 6th wondering “what the heck is halal around here?” and frantically scrambling in the group chat asking for recommendations.\n\nThe first thing that may come to your mind is The Halal Guys, but it’s too cold to stand in line and eat outside.\n\nSo I opened Google Maps, and for once, it didn’t fail me in its halal suggestions. I saw Urban Hawker listed that was two blocks away and remembered that they have a few halal stalls. I did a wrap around in the hall and also bumped into an old friend! 🥹\n\nSo if you’re out and about near the Rock, your best bet may be Urban Hawker. Please note that we’re not sure about the meats that Lady Wong uses in their pastries, but their desserts are FULLY halal! (Please try the Pandan Panna Cotta, I die.)\n\nAnd no - this isn’t a paid or sponsored post of any kind loool.\n\nMore midtown guides to come soon! 👀",

Episode 2 brings me to Namkeen located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with 5 star reviews and a couple 1 star haters that was not enough to deter me.\n\nI ordered the Tikkaville Sandwich that came out to $14 after tip. \n\nFirst impression was holy shit that is beautiful. *Jesus Christ* meme \n\nIt’s basically 2 chicken tenders slathered with tikka sauce between a toasted brioche bun. Just by looking at it, I can tell the flavors are about to be insane. That first bite was crunchy and I am happy to report that the chicken was fried and cooked perfectly. BUT DAMN , that Tikka sauce and mint chutney on fried chicken is WILD! It was tangy, sweet, a bit spicy and whole lot of delicious!\n\nI did wish it was a whole piece of chicken instead of 2 tenders and an option to customize the spice level would’ve been nice. Still, super solid and At $14, not only was this filling, but packed with incredible flavor. Overall, I’m rating this an 8.5/10.

Choose between Option A or B\n⭐️Option A: 8-10 cuts of waygu ($130 pp)\n⭐️Option B: 15+ cuts of wagyu ($160 pp)\n2. Tasting: the initial selection of cuts get brought out on a platter so you can taste each cut of meat. \n3. All you Can eat part: after finishing the first platter you can choose 3 cuts of meats that you would like to have next \n4. Keep going: for as long as your seating time or stomach space allows you can order as many rounds of 3 cuts of meat as you would like. \n\nwow, each bite of the wagyu was so soft and buttery- you can def taste the difference compared to regular steak. I would say do go with the expectations that you are eating wagyu and that it is a very fatty and heavy meat. \n\ni tapped out after round 4. Also needed to pair the meat with some kimchi and rice to cut the grease a little bit. our fav cuts were the butt pieces and the prime rib cut. 🥩\n\nThis is def one of the most unique dining experiences that I have been on. I’m glad I went to experience it but not sure if i can go back any time soon haha. \n\nthe interiors are very stylish and modern with sleek dark wood and minimalistic decor. we had a private seating area which really made it an intimate date night experience. \n\n@hyun_nyc \nktown, nyc 📍\n\nfollow @jerica.feasts for more nyc food spots ❤️\n\n#wagyua5 #allyoucaneat #nyckoreanbbq #nycfoodie #nycktowneats #a5wagyu #nycwagyu #nycbbqmeats #nycdatenight #nycspecialoccasion #nycbirthdayspots #nycnightevents",

When you walk in you step up to the counter and select your entree from a variety of soup and non-soup based udon bowls and rice bowls.  Noodles are made in house fresh daily using ingredients and wheat imported from Japan and a special filtration system for the water.  You can watch them through the glass in the rear.\n\nYour bowl is made fresh in front of you and then you head down the line to select tempura (vegetables and shrimp), pork cutlet, soft boiled eggs and some sweet options. These are all priced a la carte.\n\nThey also have a sauce station where you can make your own tempura dipping sauce. \n\nEverything is very casual and quick.  We tried the katsu curry, the sesame chicken udon which is in a sesame sauce instead of broth, a beef rice bowl and a beef udon.  Everything was really delicious but my favorite was the sesame chicken udon.\n\nPrices for the bowls range from $5.95 (Zaru Udon, cold Udon with special soy sauce) to $15.50 (fried pork cutlet curry udon). Tempura selections start at $1.95 a piece.  When we were there they had a 50% off deal on the shrimp tempura.\n\nSanuki Udon is a fun place to visit.  Sitting in the middle of NYU, it can get really busy but it's designed to get your food quick at the counter and then you find seats by the windows or the tables in the back.",

I went years ago back in 2015 when it was located in their original location and while still touristy, I thought it was a better, less crowded experience! I also got to see the infamous tuna auction too😮\n\nThis time around I got to visit kuromon market in Osaka and Nishiki market in Kyoto - both of which I thought were slightly better than Tsukiji! Kuromon market has all of the seafood and some of the stalls are the same as Tsukiji but with less crowds and actually cheaper in some instances!\n\nWe left Tsukiji after 15 minutes of roaming because we couldn’t take the crowds and we already tried what we wanted to try in the other markets 😅. However if it’s your first time, it’s worth checking out at least once but recommend going early!\n\nFollow @worldeatsjen for more Japan food recs!\n\n#kuromonmarket #japaneats #japanfoods #osakaeats #tokyoeats #tokyofood #japanfoods #japanfoodies #worldeatsjen #tsukijifishmarket",

When we got there about 30 minutes before opening, there was already a line of people who had been waiting at least an hour beforehand. Little did we know, we got extremely lucky and were the last two before the owner came out to hand everyone a ticket and closed off the line for the first half of the day! There are two seatings for the first half of the day, which is about 20 people per seating.\n\nEven though we were the first seating, they only sit a few tables at a time, so we still ended up having to wait another hour for all of the tables ahead of us to order and finish dining.\n\nWhen we finally made it into the restaurant, the menu is small as they specialize in unagi, but we ordered carp sashimi for an appetizer (I would pass on this), and two unagi boxes.  The unagi took a while to come out since each dish is made to order, but it was by far the creamiest, melt in your mouth unagi I’ve ever had.\n\nIf you love unagi and don’t mind the wait, I’d recommend getting on line at least an hour before opening so you can get into an earlier seating. Otherwise, I don’t think it’s worth the trek and time commitment if you’re not ecstatic about unagi.\n\nP.S. it’s cash only!

They have delicious grilled cheese melts, smash burgers, chicken sandwiches, loaded fries, a plethora of classic sides, and cereal-based milkshakes.\n\nHere’s our review!\n\nFood: 9/10\nThe wings here are literally finger-licking good and we’d give majority of the credit to their 18 house sauces. While the size of the wings falls kind of short, the crisp coating and their variety of sauces make up for it. That garlic parmesan sauce is too good. If you’re not in a bone-in person, they also have boneless that is a few dollars less. The Texas toast Philly cheese melt was phenomenal. It was like biting in a pillow, and flavor was on point and they didn’t skip out on the cheese, which is pretty much the most important part of a Philly cheesesteak. The great thing about this place is that you’re not limited to just wings. You can get smash burgers and chicken sandwiches that are juicy and decently sized. Their loaded waffle bowls also made it over to this location - we tried the Thai Chili Bowl that has diced chicken tenders sauced up with Thai chili sauce, on a bed of waffle fries. We also tried the sweet items like their No Cap’n Crunch Milkshake, Brooklyn Blackout Milkshake, and fried Oreos. Cereal-based milkshakes are a sweet nostalgic touch to childhood and fried Oreos were good as well.\n\n(review cont. in comments)\n\nBay Ridge House of Wings (@houseofwingsnyc)\n📍8812 3rd Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11209\n\n(Invite / collab)\n\n#halal #halalfood #halaleats #brooklyn #bayridge #nyc #halalfoodnyc #brooklyneats #brooklynfood #wings #nycwings #foodies #nycfoodies #eatingforthegram #foodreview #muslimowned #chickenwing #brooklynfoodie #newforkcity #eatingnewyork #instafood #foodstagram #foodblog #halalfoodblog #halalblogger #nycfoodblog #muslimfoodies",

Then placed on a toasted, buttery potato roll, with a maximum of 4-5 toppings or condiments to maintain that simplicity.\n\nMashed Burgers (@mashedburgers), a halal smash burgers joint, does it very well along with a humble menu of sides, milkshakes, and ice cream.\n\nFood: 9/10\nWe got the smash burger with 1 patty and a smash burger, double patty with halal beef bacon. Their default condiments and sauces are American cheese, pickles, grilled diced onions, and a house-made mash sauce. We thought both were great, well flavored and, overall perfect bites. We also had the mashed fries which has a smashed patty and it’s condiments. This was also good as the fries were crispy and nicely seasoned (Cajun). We got two milkshakes as well - Cinnamon Toast Crunch and fruity pebbles where they use Hagen Dazs ice cream as a base. It was amazingggg.

Across the board, we were satisfied with the taste and quality of the food for the price. The chicken in the couscous was very tender and full of flavor as was the lamb tajine. While the chicken tajine sandwich was good - it was hard to pick up because it was soaked with the gravy which pretty much disintegrated the bun. The seafood bastilla was great, crispy and flaky on the outside filled with nicely cooked vermicelli and shrimp on the inside. The Moroccan mint tea is always a great way to end a Moroccan feast. :)\n\nPrice: 8.5/10\nPrices are actually modest for the quality and amount of food that you receive.

We were so thrilled when this restaurant converted their menu to fully halal. \n\nFood: 10/10\nEverything was seriously so good - from the freshness of the ingredients to the juiciness of the meat to the full-blown flavor. They offer a step-by-step menu for you to choose your base, protein, and toppings. We ordered the spicy lemongrass steak banh mi sandwich, which comes with homemade chili mayo, sliced cucumbers, pickled carrots, and cilantro, and we added an egg as an add-on for an additional price. We also ordered the lemongrass chicken bowl with half jasmine rice and half spring greens. The bowls come topped with coconut corn, pickled veggies, a slice of lime, and crispy fried garlic. As a side, we got their curry fries. We love that their fries are thin and crispy, and the curry sauce poured on top makes for the perfect bite. For drinks, we ordered the thai milk tea which they make in-house. The flavor profile of all dishes was on-point. \n\nPrice: 8/10\nFairly standard for a sandwich/bowl. Some proteins and add-ons will cost you extra.\n\nAtmosphere: 8/10\nYou can’t really tell right off the bat, but there are two restaurants sharing a space so seating may be limited. Very fast-casual cafe-like vibes in a medium-sized room.\n\nService: 9/10\nYou place your order on a kiosk at the front of the restaurant and pick up your food at the counter when the chef calls your name. Food comes out rather quickly unless they are very busy.\n\nCambo Box (@cambo.box)\n📍342 George St, New Brunswick, NJ 08901\n\n(non-collab / we paid)\n\n#halal #halalfood #newjersey #cambodianfood #vietnamesefood #banhmi #halaljersey #halalfoodnewjersey #newbrunswick #rutgers #nyc #halaleats #halalvietnamesefood #halalcambodianfood #delicious #jerseyhalal #foodblog #newyorkeats #tristate #eatingforthegram #newforkcity #wheretofindhalalfood #halalfoodblog #muslimfoodies #halalrestaurant",

Especially my FAVORITE dessert shop.\n\nPersonally speaking, this is my (Jiniya’s) favorite dessert shop. Tahirah and Sameen aren’t really into desserts like that lol, but I get why. (If you guys have a favorite dessert shop, I’m sorry, I totally forgot.) I’m not into sweets like that either, but something about this place has me on lock.\n\nStick with Me is a small, Korean-owned chocolate shop in SoHo that’s famous for their artisanal chocolate bonbons. Not many people know about it like that, so I’d say in a sense, they’re pretty lowkey compared to rival chocolatiers in the city.\n\nPlease note some bonbons have gelatin or alcohol in them. It’s in the name, like the speculoos s’mores or bourbon maple pecan.\n\nI personally get the passionfruit bonbon each time 😍 it’s an explosion of flavor that never fails to twinge my tastebuds. They’re all so beautifully decorated as well. Each bonbon is $3.25. That is pricey - I’m aware. But I’m telling you, so worth it.\n\nWhat I really came for today was this Dreamsicle. Vanilla and mango passionfruit swirl soft serve. I don’t know how long they’re having this, but try it while you can. I’m genuinely a sucker for tart things and this made me so happy. The texture of the ice cream was firm and the tartness to cream ratio was perfect.\n\nAnyways, I know this isn’t a dessert review page, but thought I’d just share my favorite dessert shop with you guys since I have no one to talk about this place with and their chocolate really is amazing.\n\nIf you’ve been here, let’s connect and obsess over it in the comments? 🤪",

You can get yours here at smores n more next to the lodge in the Winter Village located in Bryant Park. \n\nYou’ll have the option to simply get a cup of hot chocolate or completely deck it out with a ton of sweets. You can choose different flavored marshmallows like the funfetti or chocolate peanut butter which gets torched to get it caramelized, and finally topped off with a piece of chocolate. \n\nThis is my favorite type of hot chocolate. Not too watery, not too rich and thick. Safe to say it’s super sweet, but thats the point right? If you want to skip the hot chocolate, you can of course get the smores which is equally delicious. \n\n@melodyamy 💜",

I’m here today at chick it out in Astoria. While they have a few varieties, this small, but mighty spot specilizes in Khao Man Gai, or simply RICE. FAT. CHICKEN\n\nI highly recommend trying the original first. While it looks simple, this humble dish will surprise you with its big flavors. The chicken is slow poached for hours and served next to ginger rice. The Thai twist here is the rice is cooked with the fat infused water from the chicken pot. The result? An insanely flavorful and slightly oily rice that complements the chicken. \n\nFor a different experience, the chicken can also be ordered fried or roasted. An alternative to the ginger rice is the equally delicious savoury curry rice. And for those of you who prefers slurping, try “The Noodle”\n\nIt’s egg noodle with roasted chicken, bok choy, fish balls, cilantro, fried garlic and collagen heavy chicken soup on the side.\n\nNext time you’re in Astoria, come by try this delicious spot and have a chat with the welcoming and friendly staff.",

You can think of it similarly to a michelin rating; however, the michelin guide isn’t as popular over in japan. There are so many omakase restaurants in japan it was difficult to choose from, but we finally settled on @hakkoku.jp due to the good reviews. \n\nYou don’t need michelin star ratings for sushi in japan because you can find great quality at even smaller local spots! The staff was fun and engaging and we got to try interesting pieces that I’ve never tried before in the U.S. like fugu which is puffer fish aka blowfish! \n\nIt’s rare to see fugu on menus in the U.S. because extreme caution and care needs to be taken when preparing and cleaning the fish because of the poison😳.\n\nThe tamago (egg sushi) at the end also tasted like a creme brulee dessert and I’ve never tasted a tamago like it before!!\n\nPrice currency conversion: ~$260 \n\nFollow @worldeatsjen for more japan food recs!\n\n#fugu #tokyoeats #tokyofoodie #tokyofood #omakaselover #omakasesushi #tokyosushi #japaneats #japanfood #worldeatsjen \n\nWould you try fugu?",

It flourished during prohibition with it’s moonshine, wild Saturday night dances, and rumored “sin cabins” out back.\n\nSesow was said to have lost the property in a poker game.

I don’t think you can find aseed in a restaurant right now except for this place, The Green Province, in Park Slope. When we were in the MSA room back in college, our friends would talk about aseed here and there and we always wondered what it tasted like for so long. And so we finally tried! 🤓\n\nSo here’s our review.\n\nThe Green Province\n📍568 4th Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11215\n\nFood: 9/10\nAseed, topped with hearty maraq (soup), is a dish eaten for any kind of meal in Yemen. It’s made of flour and boiling water. You can also add fenugreek sauce (hilbeh) for added flavor which we did. It was great. We should have eaten with our hands. 🥲 We also had lamb haneeth and chicken haneeth. Both were soft and tender, but the chicken was lighter in flavor than the lamb. The rice was so plump and flavorful and you can tell it really soaked up the broth it was cooked in very nicely. We also had their chicken vegetable soup (maraq) and lamb soup. The chicken soup was very reminiscent of Bengali-style vegetable thorkari. The lamb soup was A1 - savory, smokey, and just the right amount of viscosity. Their flatbread was baked on order and was so fluffy and chewy 🥹 we were so impressed by the quality. It was just really good.\n\nPrice: 8/10\nPrices are pretty standard. Haneeths go for $18-$30. Soup is $2.\n\nAtmosphere: 8.5/10\nIt’s a nice sit-down restaurant. You really feel like you’re dining in someone’s living room. Lots of drapery and culturally-centric interior. There are also long curtains if you prefer eating in privacy.\n\nService: 7/10\nService was more on the slow side. For the most time we were the only ones there and there was only one person working and taking orders. Food comes in around 20 min. We also had a language communication barrier so it made things a little difficult when ordering.\n\n(we paid / non-collab)\n\n#halal #brooklyn #yemenifood #yemenirestaurant #nyc #parkslope #parksloperestaurants #brooklynrestaurant #nycbucketlist #nycfood #foodie #foodblogger #foodpage #foodreview #halalfood #halaleats #halalfoodblogger #halalbucketlist #muslimfoodies",

She recommends that Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are good times to stop by.\n\nShe has both sweet and savory pastries and baked. Also a coffee bar. She plans to incorporate halal meat items in the coming weeks, and she specifically expressed that she has a desire to introduce this as it’s not been done before and that that the community needs something like this.\n\nThere are a few hours left until we break our fast so that we can try all the items we bought (which was everything) so we’ll definitely let you guys know how it goes. 💕\n\nNazli & Co.

But everything was amazing, i think the best part is ordering a couple dishes and sharing everything. \n\nft. \n- heirloom tomato panzella ($23)\n- choripan ($16)\n- empanada basket (4 empanadas, they’re massive, - $24)\n- wood fired eggplant ragu ($26)\n- parillida for two people - grilled meat plate, with blood sausage, skirtsteak, rib eye, chorizo, chicken ($105)\n- asparagus with ricotta ($18)\nmussels and spanish chorizo ($23)\n- chocolate olive oil cake ($16) \n\nLIC, nyc📍\n\nfollow @jerica.feasts for more nyc feasts ✨\n\n#nycfoodie #newyorker #hiddengems #nycrestaurants #foodblooger #viralfoods #foodtrends #explorenyc #newyork #nycfoodfind #argentinianfood #argentinanyc #empanadasnyc",

They are a cuban restaurant specialized in grilled meats as well as traditional cuban plates. 🥩\n\nall the grilled meats here were absolutely 10/10 ⭐️i highly recommend coming here and trying their steaks! it also doesn’t have the crazy price tag of some other nyc steakhouses, but the quality of the meat was amazingg. The shrimp dish we tried was also so good, it was also HUGE and flavored with garlic butter. i want to reemphasize that EVERYTHING was delicious. my personal favs were all the grilled meats (skirt steak with chimichurri if you can only order one), the garlic shrimp and the pork chops :) \n\nft. \n- cuban grilled shrimp ($12.50)\n- skirt steak with chimi churri (M.P - $39)\n- madera steak ($38)\n- grandma’s porkchop ($24)\n- paella ($32)\n- lamb chops ($28)\n\nLIC, nyc📍\n\nfollow @jerica.feasts for more nyc feasts ❤️\n\n#nyccubanfood #nycsteakhouse #nycfoodie #nycgrilledmeats #cubangrileldmeats #licfood",

Not only was this visually appealing the duck was also some of the best i’ve ever had. \n\nThe duck is served 3 ways and the meat is SO juicy and filled with flavor.💫\n\n@goldenwuishnyc combines traditional Chinese dishes with elevated design. I personally think the pricing here is very reasonable for the portion sizes and quality of the dishes!  Elevated Chinese cuisine that can still maintain the hearty flavors of the traditional dishes are hard to find, but Golden wuish nailed it.\n\nThe flaming duck is a cannot miss experience, served 3  ways: \n1) flamed and eaten in thin flour wraps with cucumber and sauce the traditional style\n2) torched and smoked with lychee wood which added extra flavor to the duck\n3) then the rest of the duck is served in a tofu soup. \n\nAll 3 ways were amazing and the duck left a very memorable impression on us.\n\nOur other personal favs were the A5 wagyu, lamb chops (so tender) and I personally really like the cucumber and wood ear salad.🥩🔥\n\nFt.\n- The peking duck experience ($98- call restaurant two hours ahead to reserve the duck )\n- Cucumber salad ($15)\n- A5 Wagyu on hot stone ($30) \n- Lamb chops ($28) \n\nfidi, nyc 📍\n\nfollow @jerica.feasts for more nyc feasts ❤️\n\n#nyceats #newyorkfoodie #fidifood #feasting #nycfood",

There’s a daily menu of select options you can choose from that will change up seasonally.\n\nIt’s strawberry season in japan during spring so I’d recommend getting their fruity ones! The ice was so soft and fluffy and presentation was on point. You can watch them craft each layer in this open kitchen counter style seating which has a limited amount of seats each day.\n\nWe tried the strawberry with torched chiboust cream on top (my favorite) & the hassaku orange with meringue. If you don’t know what something is, I’d recommend asking or searching it up online because I didn’t realize hassaku orange is equivalent to a grapefruit & it ended up being super tart (especially if you’re not a fan of grapefruit🥲). \n\nFor reservations:\nI used @tablecheck_global to book with reservations opening 7 days in advance at 9pm japan time! You’ll have to place a small deposit to hold the reservation which gets put towards your bill. Each kakigori will run you ~$18-20 depending on the exchange rate!\n\nSAVE THIS FOR YOUR NEXT TRIP TO JAPAN!\n\n#kakigori #japaneats #japanfood #japanfoods #japandessert #japanfoodie #tokyoeats #tokyofood #worldeatsjen",

We tried their braised beef noodle soup.  The beef was tender, the soup was fragrant and the noodles had a great texture and chew.  The Seafoods Pan-Fried Crispy Noodles was light, creamy and so satisfying. \n\nWe finished our meal with the  Pumpkin Fritters, Ube Red Bean Bao and Black Sesame Custard Bao.\n\nIf you haven't tried @nanxiangsoupdumpling head over to their newest location (2 floors).\n\n📍 Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao (15 St. Marks\nPlace)\n🐲 @patricknvrsleeps \n\n#restaurantopening #grandopeningparty #eastvillageeats #soupdumplings #soupdumpling #xiaolongbao #nycrestaurants #stmarksnyc #dumplinglove #theHungrySkipper \n🥟🥟🥟\n\nWhat's your go to soup dumpling?",

This time I came for the BBQ.\n\nRib No. 7 in KoreaTown takes Woodae Galbi to the next level by serving only the best cuts of meat. Woodae Galbi, is a term used to describe bone-in meat that is cut lengthwise from the 6th to 8th ribs. These cuts are known for their excellent texture and tenderness, with the 7th being the best selection, and where their name came from.\n\nWe started with cocktails no for appetizers, we ordered the Yukhoe (Beef tartare topped with Korean pear and a raw quail egg), Uni Bibim Bap and Shroom Japchae.  All 3 were delicious but the ones I keep thinking about were the beef tartare and the japchae.\n\nFor dinner we went with the Prince’s Feast since we wanted to also have the Sam Gyup Sal (thick white marble pork belly), hand rubbed marinated beef rib and of course the dressed up (marinated) Oodae Galbi, a/k/a the 7th rib.  We also added a prime ribeye.\n\nTip: we did this over the King’s Feast which has a few different cuts, in particular a “nude” Oodae Galbi (7th rib with no marinade) and the chuck flap tail (short rib) so we could get have the pork belly also.  Both are solid choices and next time I would try this one instead.\n\nThe staff cooks table side so you can relax and enjoy these impeccable cuts of meat.  When you visit make sure to come with friends. If you go with 4 you can definitely try more dishes.\n\n@ribno7  is located at 32W33rd st.

Head straight back when you get off the escalator and you will find them in the corner at booth #29.\n\nThere's aojg line for the Baos, which are juicy and delicious.  The bottom is fried and the dough is thicker than steamed soup dumplings but the crisp bao bottom gives a crrst contrast to the meet and soup inside.\n\nWe also tried the beef noodle soup and robs noodle soup (more of a pork chop). The noodles have a nice bite to them and the soup had a deep flavor.  They have shrimp, vegetable, and pork and cabbage wonton.  The wonton broth is much lighter than the noodle bowls.  For more protein you can also order the brwided duck (the sauce would be great on rice) and salted chicken.\n\nThe star of Pan Bao is, of course, the pan-fried juicy pork baos (buns) but they have other options to choose from and you can also get combs with baos and different sooups.\n\nThe baos come in orders of 6 and 8 and are $8.99 and 10.99.  the combos rsnte from $13/15 with 8 baos and $15/17 with 10 baos.\n\nLIKE and SAVE for later and follow @theHungrySkipper for more yummy eats.\n\n#panbao66 #panbao #newworldmall #newworldmallfoodcourt #flushingqueens #flushing #soupdumplings #crispybottoms #baobuns #bao ·  #friedbao #flushingeats #flushingfood #shanghaifood #panfrieddumplings #panfried #braisedduck #bunlove #baolovers #bảo ·  #nyceeeeeats #nyceeeeats #foodcourt #chinatowneats #chinatownflushing  #theHungrySkipper",

The lechon was SO TENDER, I’m still drooling thinking about this dish.\n\nWe also created our own with moringa pasta and garlic butter, braised short ribs, and more lechon on the side. The portions were way bigger than we expected and our dishes could have easily fed another person or two.\n\nWe ended off our meal with a lychee cheesecake which had actual bits of lychee. It was an interesting flavor combo but next time would opt to try out the guava or ube. \n\nThis spot is a little bit off the beaten path but totally worth a visit!\n\n@worldeatsjen #hawaiieats #hawaiifood #hawaiifoodfinds #hawaiifoodreviews #oahueats #hawaiifoods #adelascountryeatery",

The collab features a dover sole with sherry lemon paired with a senkin “issei” junmai daiginjo. We got to learn from their sommelier about the different pairings, flavor notes, and process!\n\nMost people think of white wine when they think about seafood, but the pairing of seafood and sake enhances the umami in each dish! The flavor notes of sake are complex where temperature and even the polishing ratio (percentage of rice that remains after the husk is polished off) can impact the flavor!\n\n@claud_nyc was opened by two alums from Michelin star momofuku ko! Table reservations are hard to get so you know it’s good! Everything was cooked to perfection even down to their sourdough bread baked in-house! Their menu offerings change almost every day so you’ll get to taste a variety👀.

Their artichoke flan was also so flavorful.\n\nYou’re going to want to take a look at all of the books they have on display with the most beautiful illustrations, I went downstairs to check out more and found a Harley look a like I was so excited and  bought this book immediately!! 🤩 Keep an eye out for their fun events, you have to come here ASAP! ✨ #glamorousgrub \n\n#nyc #nycrestaurant #italianrestaurant #bookstore #westvillage #hiddengem #nychiddengem #pasta #spritz #newyorkcity #thingstodonyc #italianfood",

These are no joke and for sure the best meatballs I’ve ever had 👨🏻‍🍳💋 We also started with their perfect caesar salad, braised artichokes, their wild mushroom bruschetta, and is if things couldn’t get better, next in the lineup was their GIANT ONE POUND ball of mozzarella 🤯Everything was so delicious. \n\nNext, we tried their vodka chicken parm and mushroom-brie pizzas. I love how thin and crispy the crust was. Fun fact they also have drunk pizza making parties! \n\nNow.. for my favorite part… the pastas 🤤This Wild Mushroom Ravioli is 100% one of my top pasta dishes. 🥇The brown butter sage sauce is mouthwatering. The butternut squash pasta was amazing. This is their baked lasagna bolognese, and last but not least, their rigatoni a la vodka 🧡 You guys know I love this dish and this is the best one out there. \n\nThey also have a party room called the red room 🥳 This is definitely one of my new favorite restaurants.

Each cut is meticulously prepared, offering an explosion of flavors and textures. 👌🔥\n\n🍽️ What I love about this place is the simplicity of the menu. No need to stress over a massive list of options—just order them all! 🙌 You can truly taste the distinct differences among the fresh, 14-day aged, and 30-day aged pork belly. The textures and flavors evolve in such a fascinating way, it’s like an experiment on your tongue! 🧪👅\n\n🍶 And let’s not forget the beverages! Traditional Korean drinks like somac (soju + beer) and makgeolli (rice wine) complement the meal perfectly. 🍻🍶\n\nThe vibe? Casual street restaurant style, making it super cozy and inviting. 🌿🪑 Perfect spot to enjoy an unforgettable meal with friends or family.\n\n📍Don Don Korean BBQ @dondon.nyc \n📍37 W 43rd St, New York, NY 10036\n\n#DonDonRestaurant #ChefShim #KoreanBBQ #DryAgedPork #NYCEats #FoodieHeaven #MichelinStarMagic #FoodAdventure #newyorkfood #newyorklife #newyorkcity #newyork #newyorkfoodie #nycblogger #nyclife #nyclifestyle #nyc #newyork #newyorkcity #nycfoodies #newyorkfood",

Fresh sea urchin, perfectly grilled steak, and a rich Korean soybean soup - it’s comfort food elevated! 💯\n\n🍨 Don’t forget dessert! The royal dessert platter is a work of art (that plate though! 😍). Sip on some hot tea, indulge in black sesame ice cream and chestnut cake for the perfect sweet ending.\n\nWangbi isn’t just a meal, it’s an experience that’ll have you planning your next visit before you even leave! 🥰\n\n📍Wangbi @wangbi.nyc \n📍Mezzanine Level, 37 W 32nd St, New York, NY 10001\n\n#NYCEats #KoreanFusion #BeefOmakase #FoodieHeaven #newyorkfood #newyorklife #newyorkcity #newyork #newyorkfoodie #nycblogger #nyclife #nyclifestyle #nyc #newyork #newyorkcity #nycfoodies #newyorkfood #foodielife #foodies #foodienyc #blogger#bloggerstyle #bloggerlife #newyork #newyorkCity #nyc#nycfood #nycfoodie #eatingthingsinnewyork #nybucketlist#whatshouldwedo",
