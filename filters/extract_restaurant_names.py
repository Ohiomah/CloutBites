# This script performs a regex search to find likely restaurant names in the 'caption' field of each entry in IG_posts.json,
# which was scraped previously via the Apify Instagram scraper for keywords 'NYC restaurants' and 'NYC foodies'. After identifying
# a potential name using the @ symbol, it attempts to visit the corresponding Instagram profile using BeautifulSoup to extract
# the official name. The script then checks if the extracted name exists in merged_restaurants_final.csv and updates the JSON
# file with the results.
